The advent of high-throughput technologies—from next-generation sequencing to automated microscopy to mass spectrometry—has generated an explosion of data that far exceeds what can be analyzed manually. Consider these examples:\n\n- A single human genome sequence contains approximately **6 billion base pairs**\n- A typical RNA-seq experiment generates **tens of millions** of short reads\n- Proteomics studies can identify and quantify **thousands of proteins** simultaneously\n- High-content imaging screens produce **terabytes** of image data\n\nTo make sense of this data deluge, researchers must be fluent in computational tools. This fluency goes beyond simply running pre-made software—it requires understanding how to manipulate data, automate analyses, and ensure reproducibility.\n\n## Why Learn Computational Skills?\n\nThere are compelling reasons to invest time in developing computational proficiency:\n\n**Speed and Scale.** Computational tools allow you to perform thousands of operations with single commands. Tasks that would take days by hand can be completed in seconds.\n\n**Reproducibility.** Scripts and code serve as a complete record of your analysis. Unlike clicking through graphical interfaces, command-line workflows can be exactly reproduced, shared, and verified [@sandve2013ten; @wilson2017good].\n\n**Flexibility.** General-purpose programming languages can handle virtually any data format or analysis type. You're not limited to what software developers anticipated.\n\n**Access to Specialized Tools.** Many cutting-edge analysis tools in bioinformatics are only available through the command line. Learning to use the shell opens doors to thousands of free programs developed by scientists for scientists.\n\n**High-Performance Computing.** Large-scale analyses require computing clusters. These systems are accessed and controlled through command-line interfaces.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Career Impact\"}\nComputational skills are increasingly valued in academic and industry positions. Investing in these skills now will pay dividends throughout your career. Organizing your computational projects well from the start saves countless hours later [@noble2009quick].\n:::\n\n## Coding vs. Scripting: What's the Difference?\n\nYou'll often hear the terms \"coding\" and \"scripting\" used interchangeably, but there are technical distinctions worth understanding.\n\n### Compiled Languages (Coding)\n\n**Compiled languages** require a separate compilation step that translates human-readable source code into machine code before execution. Examples include:\n\n- C/C++\n- Fortran\n- Rust\n- Go\n\nThe compilation process produces optimized executable files that run very quickly. However, compiled languages typically require more setup and are less forgiving of errors during development.\n\n### Interpreted Languages (Scripting)\n\n**Interpreted languages** (or scripting languages) execute code line-by-line at runtime, without a separate compilation step. Examples include:\n\n- Bash/Shell\n- Python\n- R\n- Julia\n- Perl\n\nInterpreted languages offer greater flexibility and faster development cycles at the cost of some execution speed. They're ideal for data analysis, automation, and interactive exploration.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe distinction between compiled and interpreted languages has become increasingly blurred. Modern systems like Julia use just-in-time (JIT) compilation to achieve near-compiled performance with scripting-language convenience. Python and R can also interface with compiled C/C++ code for performance-critical operations.\n:::\n\n### Which Should You Learn?\n\nFor most biological research, **interpreted languages are the right choice**. They offer:\n\n- Rapid prototyping and experimentation\n- Interactive data exploration\n- Extensive libraries for scientific computing\n- Lower barriers to entry for beginners\n\nIn this course, we focus primarily on Bash (the Unix shell) and R, with exposure to high-performance computing concepts that may eventually lead you to compiled languages if your research requires it.\n\n## Tools We Will Cover\n\nThis book and accompanying course introduce you to a carefully selected set of tools that form the foundation of computational research in the life sciences [@buffalo2015bioinformatics].\n\n### Unix/Linux and the Shell\n\nThe **Unix shell** (specifically Bash) provides:\n\n- A powerful interface for file manipulation\n- Tools for processing large text-based data files\n- The ability to combine simple programs into complex workflows\n- Access to remote computing systems\n\nUnderstanding Unix is essential because it underlies most scientific computing infrastructure, from laptops to supercomputers.\n\n### R Statistical Programming\n\n**R** is a programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics [@rproject2024]. It offers:\n\n- Comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities\n- Publication-quality graphics\n- Thousands of packages for specialized analyses\n- Integration with reproducible document systems (Quarto, R Markdown)\n- An excellent IDE (RStudio)\n\n### Quarto and Reproducible Documents\n\n**Quarto** is an open-source scientific publishing system [@quarto2024] that allows you to:\n\n- Combine narrative text with executable code\n- Generate reports, presentations, websites, and books\n- Ensure your analyses are fully reproducible\n- Share your work in multiple formats\n\nThis book itself was written using Quarto!\n\n### Git and GitHub\n\n**Git** is a version control system that tracks changes to your files over time [@chacon2014pro; @blischak2016practical]. **GitHub** is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. Together, they enable:\n\n- Complete history of your project's development\n- Safe experimentation with new ideas\n- Collaboration with colleagues worldwide\n- Sharing code and data publicly\n\n### High-Performance Computing\n\n**Talapas** is the University of Oregon's computing cluster. You'll learn to:\n\n- Access and navigate the cluster\n- Submit and manage batch jobs\n- Use software modules\n- Scale your analyses beyond your laptop's capabilities\n\n## Setting Up Your Computing Environment\n\nBefore diving into the technical content, you'll need to set up your computing environment. The required software depends on your operating system.\n\n### All Operating Systems\n\nThese tools work across Windows, macOS, and Linux:\n\n1. **R** — Download from [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org)\n2. **RStudio** — Download from [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)\n3. **Visual Studio Code** — Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n4. **Git** — Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)\n\n### macOS Users\n\nmacOS includes a Unix-based operating system. To access the shell:\n\n1. Open **Terminal** (found in Applications → Utilities) or\n2. Install **iTerm2** for a more feature-rich terminal experience\n\n### Linux Users\n\nLinux systems include multiple terminal applications. Open your distribution's default terminal emulator, often called \"Terminal\" or \"Console.\"\n\n### Windows Users {#sec-windows-setup}\n\nWindows requires additional setup to access a Unix-like environment. The recommended approach uses Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Windows Users: Additional Steps Required\"}\nFollow these steps to install Ubuntu on Windows:\n\n1. Run **Windows PowerShell** as administrator\n2. Type `wsl --install` and press Enter\n3. Restart your computer\n4. Search for and install **Ubuntu** from the Microsoft Store, or type `wsl --install -d ubuntu` in PowerShell\n5. Open Ubuntu and set up a username and password (doesn't need to match your Windows login)\n6. Run `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt upgrade` to update packages\n:::\n\nA detailed guide is available at [ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10).\n\n### Talapas Access\n\nTo use the university's computing cluster:\n\n1. Ensure you're a member of a PIRG (Principal Investigator Research Group)\n2. Your login credentials are your Duck ID and password\n3. Off-campus access requires the UO VPN\n\nWe'll cover Talapas access in detail in @sec-hpc-talapas.\n\n## Course Structure and Expectations\n\nThis book is designed to accompany a hands-on course where **most of class time is devoted to coding practice** rather than lectures. Expect to:\n\n- Follow along with examples during class sessions\n- Complete practice exercises to reinforce concepts\n- Submit homework assignments demonstrating your skills\n- Develop a final project applying what you've learned to your own research\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Learning Takes Practice\"}\nComputational skills develop through repeated practice. Don't be discouraged if concepts don't click immediately—everyone struggles at first. The key is persistence and willingness to experiment.\n:::\n\n## Getting Help\n\nWhen you encounter problems (and you will!), several resources are available:\n\n**Manual Pages.** Unix commands have built-in documentation accessible via `man command_name`. Type `q` to exit.\n\n**Help Functions.** In R, use `?function_name` or `help(function_name)` to access documentation.\n\n**The Internet.** Sites like Stack Overflow contain solutions to virtually every common error message. Learning to search effectively is a crucial skill.\n\n**Generative AI.** Tools like ChatGPT and Claude can explain concepts, debug code, and suggest solutions. However, always verify AI-generated code and understand what it does before using it.\n\n![Discriminative models predict labels from features by learning decision boundaries, while generative models learn the underlying probability distributions of data to generate new content. Understanding this distinction helps you choose the right AI tool for your task.](images/ai_discriminative_vs_generative.png){#fig-discriminative-generative-ai width=\"80%\"}\n\n**Each Other.** Your classmates are experiencing the same learning curve.
