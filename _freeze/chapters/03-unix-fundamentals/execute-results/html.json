What began as a project for a single computer has become the foundation of modern computing infrastructure.\n\nToday, Unix and its derivatives power:\n\n- Most web servers on the internet\n- Scientific computing clusters (including Talapas)\n- macOS (Apple's desktop operating system)\n- Android phones (via the Linux kernel)\n- Embedded systems in everything from routers to cars\n\n**Linux** is an open-source implementation of Unix principles that has become the dominant operating system for scientific computing. When we refer to \"Unix commands\" in this book, the same commands work on Linux, macOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nLearning Unix is an investment that pays dividends throughout your career. The commands you learn today will work on systems you encounter decades from now—Unix's longevity is remarkable in the fast-changing world of technology.\n:::\n\n### The Unix Philosophy\n\nThe tools we use in Unix embody a design philosophy that emerged from Bell Labs in the 1970s:\n\n> **Do One Thing And Do It Well**\n\nEach Unix command is designed to perform a single task excellently. By combining simple, well-designed tools, you can build powerful and complex workflows. This \"minimalist and modular\" approach means:\n\n- Tools are easier to learn (each does one thing)\n- Tools are easier to combine (standardized input/output)\n- Complex tasks become chains of simple operations\n\nYou'll see this philosophy throughout Unix: `cat` just displays files, `grep` just searches for patterns, `sort` just sorts lines. The magic happens when you combine them.\n\n## The Shell: Your Interface to Unix {#sec-shell-interface}\n\nThe **shell** is a program that interprets your commands and communicates with the operating system. Think of it as a translator between human-readable instructions and the computer's internal operations.\n\nWhile graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like Finder on Mac or File Explorer on Windows are intuitive for casual use, the shell offers:\n\n- **Speed**: Type commands faster than clicking through menus\n- **Power**: Access to thousands of specialized tools\n- **Automation**: Script repetitive tasks\n- **Remote Access**: Work on distant computers identically to local ones\n- **Reproducibility**: Document exactly what you did\n\n### Bash: The Default Shell\n\n**Bash** (Bourne Again SHell) is the default shell on most Unix systems and is what you'll use throughout this course. Other shells exist (zsh, fish, tcsh), but Bash is the most widely used and what you'll encounter on computing clusters.\n\n### Accessing the Shell\n\nHow you access the shell depends on your operating system:\n\n**macOS**\n:   Open the **Terminal** application (Applications → Utilities → Terminal) or use a third-party terminal like iTerm2.\n\n**Linux**\n:   Open your distribution's terminal application, often called \"Terminal\" or \"Console.\"\n\n**Windows**\n:   After installing WSL (see @sec-windows-setup), search for \"Ubuntu\" or your installed Linux distribution in the Start menu.\n\nWhen you open the terminal, you'll see a **prompt** indicating the system is ready for your command:\n\n```bash\nusername@computer:~$\n```\n\nThe prompt typically shows your username, the computer name, your current directory (`~` means your home directory), and a `$` symbol indicating you're a regular user (a `#` would indicate administrator/root access).\n\n### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nLearning these shortcuts will dramatically speed up your command-line work:\n\n| Shortcut | Action |\n|:---------|:-------|\n| `Tab` | Auto-complete commands, file names, and paths |\n| `↑` / `↓` | Scroll through command history |\n| `Ctrl+A` | Move cursor to beginning of line |\n| `Ctrl+E` | Move cursor to end of line |\n| `Ctrl+U` | Delete everything before cursor |\n| `Ctrl+K` | Delete everything after cursor |\n| `Ctrl+W` | Delete word before cursor |\n| `Ctrl+R` | Search through command history |\n| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current command |\n| `Ctrl+L` or `clear` | Clear the terminal screen |\n\n: Essential shell keyboard shortcuts {#tbl-keyboard-shortcuts}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n**Tab completion is your best friend!** Start typing a file name and press Tab—the shell will complete it for you. If there are multiple matches, press Tab twice to see all options. This prevents typos and saves enormous amounts of typing.\n:::\n\n## Anatomy of a Shell Command {#sec-shell-command-anatomy}\n\nEvery shell command follows a consistent structure:\n\n```bash\ncommand -options arguments\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n**Command**\n:   The program or built-in function you want to run. This is required.\n\n**Options** (also called flags)\n:   Modify the command's behavior. Usually preceded by `-` (single letter) or `--` (full word). Optional.\n\n**Arguments**\n:   What the command should operate on—typically file or directory names. Sometimes optional.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nls -l Documents\n```\n\nHere, `ls` is the command (list directory contents), `-l` is an option (use long format with details), and `Documents` is the argument (which directory to list).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nOptions can often be combined. For example, `ls -l -h -a` can be written as `ls -lha`. The order of combined options usually doesn't matter.\n:::\n\n### Getting Help: The `man` Command\n\nEvery Unix command has a manual page accessible via the `man` command:\n\n```bash\n$ man ls\n```\n\nThis opens the manual for `ls`, showing all available options and usage examples. Navigation within `man`:\n\n- **Space** or **f** — Move forward one page\n- **b** — Move back one page\n- **/pattern** — Search for \"pattern\" (press `n` for next match)\n- **h** — Show help for navigating the manual\n- **q** — Quit and return to the shell\n\nFor a quicker summary, many commands support `--help`:\n\n```bash\n$ ls --help\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nWhen you encounter an unfamiliar command, `man` should be your first stop. The manuals are comprehensive and authoritative—they're written by the people who created the commands.\n:::\n\n## Understanding the File System {#sec-file-system}\n\nUnix organizes everything as files within a hierarchical directory structure. Understanding this structure is essential for navigation.\n\n### The Directory Tree\n\nThe entire file system branches from a single root directory, represented by `/`:\n\n```\n/\n├── Users/\n│   └── wcresko/\n│       ├── Documents/\n│       ├── Downloads/\n│       └── projects/\n├── Applications/\n├── Library/\n└── tmp/\n```\n\nKey directories include:\n\n**`/`**\n:   The root directory. Everything else is inside this.\n\n**`/home` or `/Users`**\n:   Contains user home directories. Your files live here.\n\n**`~`**\n:   Shorthand for your home directory (e.g., `/home/wcresko`).\n\n**`/tmp`**\n:   Temporary files that may be deleted on reboot.\n\n### Absolute vs. Relative Paths\n\nA **path** specifies the location of a file or directory. Paths come in two forms:\n\n**Absolute Paths**\n:   Start from the root directory (`/`). They work from anywhere because they specify the complete location.\n```bash\n/Users/wcresko/Documents/analysis.R\n```\n\n**Relative Paths**\n:   Start from your current directory. Shorter but depend on where you are.\n```bash\nDocuments/analysis.R\n```\n\n![Understanding file system paths: This diagram shows how an absolute path like `/home/catchen/working` is constructed by following the directory tree from root (`/`) through each level.](images/Directory_example.jpeg){#fig-paths width=\"70%\"}\n\nSpecial directory references:\n\n- `.` (single dot) — current directory\n- `..` (double dot) — parent directory (one level up)\n- `~` — your home directory\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nUse Tab completion! Start typing a file or directory name and press Tab to autocomplete. This saves typing and prevents errors.\n:::\n\n## Essential Navigation Commands {#sec-navigation-commands}\n\n### Where Am I? `pwd`\n\nThe `pwd` command (**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory) shows your current location:\n```bash\n$ pwd\n/Users/wcresko/projects/analysis\n```\n\nAlways know where you are before running commands—especially destructive ones!\n\n### What's Here? `ls`\n\nThe `ls` command (**l**i**s**t) shows directory contents:\n\n```bash\n$ ls\ndata/  results/  analysis.R  README.md\n```\n\nCommon options make `ls` more informative:\n\n| Option | Description |\n|:-------|:------------|\n| `-l` | Long format (permissions, size, date) |\n| `-a` | Show hidden files (those starting with `.`) |\n| `-h` | Human-readable file sizes (KB, MB, GB) |\n| `-t` | Sort by modification time (newest first) |\n| `-S` | Sort by file size (largest first) |\n| `-r` | Reverse sort order |\n| `-F` | Add symbols to show file types (`/` for directories, `*` for executables) |\n\n: Common options for the `ls` command {#tbl-ls-options}\n\nExample with multiple options:\n```bash\n$ ls -lah\ntotal 32K\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 wcresko staff 128B Nov 15 14:30 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 wcresko staff 384B Nov 14 09:15 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 wcresko staff 2.1K Nov 15 14:30 analysis.R\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 wcresko staff  96B Nov 15 10:00 data\n-rw-r--r--  1 wcresko staff  512 Nov 14 09:15 README.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 wcresko staff  64B Nov 15 14:00 results\n```\n\nThe long format shows: permissions, links, owner, group, size, modification date, and name.\n\n### Moving Around: `cd`\n\nThe `cd` command (**c**hange **d**irectory) moves you to a different location:\n\n```bash\n# Go to a specific directory\n$ cd Documents\n\n# Go up one directory\n$ cd ..\n\n# Go to home directory (three equivalent ways)\n$ cd ~\n$ cd $HOME\n$ cd\n\n# Go to the previous directory (like \"back\" in a browser)\n$ cd -\n\n# Go to an absolute path\n$ cd /Users/wcresko/projects\n```\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\nUnlike GUIs, `cd` gives no feedback when successful. If you don't see an error message, the command worked! Use `pwd` to verify where you ended up.\n:::\n\n## Working with Files and Directories {#sec-working-with-files}\n\nNow that you can navigate, let's learn to manipulate files and directories.\n\n### Creating Directories: `mkdir`\n\n```bash\n# Create a single directory\n$ mkdir analysis\n\n# Create nested directories (use -p for parents)\n$ mkdir -p project/data/raw\n\n# Create multiple directories at once\n$ mkdir results figures tables\n```\n\n### Creating Files: `touch` and `nano`\n\nThe `touch` command creates an empty file (or updates the timestamp of an existing file):\n\n```bash\n$ touch notes.txt\n```\n\nFor files with content, use a text editor. `nano` is a simple terminal-based editor:\n\n```bash\n$ nano notes.txt\n```\n\nIn nano:\n- Type your content normally\n- `Ctrl+O` saves the file (press Enter to confirm)\n- `Ctrl+X` exits nano\n\n### Copying Files: `cp`\n\n```bash\n# Copy a file\n$ cp original.txt backup.txt\n\n# Copy a file to a directory\n$ cp analysis.R scripts/\n\n# Copy a directory (requires -r for recursive)\n$ cp -r data/ data_backup/\n\n# Copy multiple files to a directory\n$ cp *.txt documents/\n```\n\n### Moving and Renaming: `mv`\n\nThe `mv` command both moves and renames files:\n\n```bash\n# Rename a file\n$ mv oldname.txt newname.txt\n\n# Move a file to a directory\n$ mv analysis.R scripts/\n\n# Move and rename simultaneously\n$ mv data/raw.csv backup/raw_2024.csv\n\n# Move multiple files\n$ mv *.R scripts/\n```\n\n### Deleting Files: `rm` and `rmdir`\n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"Danger Zone\"}\nThe shell has no trash can! Deleted files are gone forever. Always double-check before using `rm`, especially with wildcards.\n:::\n\n```bash\n# Remove a file\n$ rm unnecessary.txt\n\n# Remove multiple files\n$ rm *.tmp\n\n# Remove a directory and all contents (DANGEROUS!)\n$ rm -r old_project/\n\n# Interactive mode (asks for confirmation)\n$ rm -i important.txt\n\n# Remove empty directories only\n$ rmdir empty_folder/\n```\n\nThe `-r` (recursive) option with `rm` is powerful but dangerous. Consider using `-i` (interactive) to confirm each deletion when learning.\n\n### Viewing Files: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`\n\n```bash\n# Display entire file\n$ cat README.md\n\n# First 10 lines (or specify -n NUMBER)\n$ head data.csv\n$ head -n 20 data.csv\n\n# Last 10 lines\n$ tail data.csv\n$ tail -n 5 data.csv\n\n# Follow a file as it grows (great for logs)\n$ tail -f analysis.log\n\n# Page through a large file\n$ less huge_data.txt\n```\n\nIn `less`:\n- Space or `f` — next page\n- `b` — previous page\n- `/pattern` — search forward\n- `n` — next search result\n- `q` — quit\n\n### File Information: `wc`\n\nThe `wc` (**w**ord **c**ount) command provides file statistics:\n\n```bash\n$ wc document.txt\n  100   850  5420 document.txt\n```\n\nThis shows: lines, words, and bytes. Useful options:\n\n```bash\n$ wc -l data.csv   # Lines only\n$ wc -w essay.txt  # Words only\n$ wc -c file.bin   # Bytes only\n```\n\n### Finding Files: `find`\n\nThe `find` command searches for files and directories based on various criteria:\n\n```bash\n# Find by name (case-insensitive with -iname)\n$ find . -iname \"*.csv\"\n\n# Find files modified in the last 7 days\n$ find ~/projects -mtime -7\n\n# Find files larger than 100MB\n$ find . -size +100M\n\n# Find and do something with results\n$ find . -name \"*.tmp\" -delete\n```\n\nThe `find` command is powerful for locating files across complex directory structures. Common options:\n\n| Option | Description |\n|:-------|:------------|\n| `-name` | Match filename (case-sensitive) |\n| `-iname` | Match filename (case-insensitive) |\n| `-type f` | Find files only |\n| `-type d` | Find directories only |\n| `-size +10M` | Larger than 10 megabytes |\n| `-mtime -7` | Modified within 7 days |\n\n: Common `find` options {#tbl-find-options}\n\n## Naming Conventions {#sec-naming-conventions}\n\nGood naming practices prevent countless problems:\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"File Naming Rules\"}\n**DO:**\n- Use lowercase letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`)\n- Use meaningful, descriptive names\n- Include dates in ISO format if relevant: `data_2024-01-15.csv`\n- Use appropriate file extensions\n\n**DON'T:**\n- Use spaces (use `_` or `-` instead)\n- Start names with `-` (confused with options)\n- Use special characters: `* ? [ ] ' \" \\ / < > |`\n- Use extremely long names\n:::\n\nExamples:\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:----|:-----|\n| `my data.csv` | `my_data.csv` |\n| `-results.txt` | `results.txt` |\n| `data (copy).csv` | `data_copy.csv` |\n| `Joe's file.txt` | `joes_file.txt` |\n\n## Getting Help {#sec-unix-getting-help}\n\n### Manual Pages\n\nEvery Unix command has a manual page accessible via `man`:\n\n```bash\n$ man ls\n```\n\nManual pages can be dense. Look for:\n- **NAME**: What the command does\n- **SYNOPSIS**: How to use it\n- **DESCRIPTION**: Detailed explanation\n- **OPTIONS**: Available flags\n- **EXAMPLES**: If you're lucky!\n\nPress `q` to exit the manual.\n\n### Quick Help\n\nMany commands support a `--help` option:\n\n```bash\n$ ls --help\n```\n\n### Searching for Commands\n\nIf you know what you want to do but not the command:\n\n```bash\n# Search man page descriptions\n$ man -k \"search term\"\n$ apropos \"search term\"\n\n# Find where a command is located\n$ which python\n```\n\n## File Permissions and Ownership {#sec-file-permissions}\n\nUnix is a multi-user system, and every file has permissions controlling who can read, write, or execute it. Understanding permissions is essential for security and for running scripts.\n\n### Understanding Permission Strings\n\nWhen you run `ls -l`, you see permission strings like:\n\n```bash\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 wcresko staff 2048 Jan 15 10:30 analysis.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 wcresko staff   96 Jan 15 09:00 data\n```\n\nLet's decode `-rwxr-xr-x`:\n\n| Position | Meaning |\n|:---------|:--------|\n| 1st character | Type: `-` (file), `d` (directory), `l` (link) |\n| Characters 2-4 | **Owner** permissions: `rwx` |\n| Characters 5-7 | **Group** permissions: `r-x` |\n| Characters 8-10 | **Others** permissions: `r-x` |\n\nThe three permission types are:\n\n- **r** (read): View file contents or list directory\n- **w** (write): Modify file or add/remove files in directory\n- **x** (execute): Run file as program or enter directory\n- **-**: Permission denied for that operation\n\n### Changing Permissions: `chmod`\n\nThe `chmod` command changes file permissions. There are two notations:\n\n**Symbolic notation:**\n\n```bash\n# Add execute permission for owner\n$ chmod u+x script.sh\n\n# Remove write permission for group and others\n$ chmod go-w data.csv\n\n# Set exact permissions (owner: rwx, group: rx, others: rx)\n$ chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx script.sh\n```\n\n**Octal notation** (uses numbers 0-7):\n\n| Number | Permission |\n|:-------|:-----------|\n| 7 | rwx (read + write + execute) |\n| 6 | rw- (read + write) |\n| 5 | r-x (read + execute) |\n| 4 | r-- (read only) |\n| 0 | --- (no permissions) |\n\n```bash\n# Common permission sets\n$ chmod 755 script.sh    # rwxr-xr-x (executable script)\n$ chmod 644 data.csv     # rw-r--r-- (readable file)\n$ chmod 700 private/     # rwx------ (private directory)\n```\n\n### Changing Ownership: `chown`\n\nThe `chown` command changes file ownership:\n\n```bash\n# Change owner\n$ chown alice myfile.txt\n\n# Change owner and group\n$ chown alice:researchers myfile.txt\n\n# Recursively change directory ownership\n$ chown -R alice:researchers project/\n```\n\n### Superuser Access: `sudo`\n\nSome operations require administrator (root) privileges. The `sudo` command temporarily elevates your permissions:\n\n```bash\n# Install software (requires admin rights)\n$ sudo apt install cowsay\n\n# Edit a system file\n$ sudo nano /etc/hosts\n```\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nUse `sudo` carefully! With great power comes great responsibility. Commands run with `sudo` can modify or delete system files, potentially breaking your computer. Always double-check commands before running them with `sudo`.\n:::\n\n## Summary {#sec-unix-summary}\n\nThis chapter covered the fundamentals of Unix navigation and file manipulation:\n\n- The shell interprets commands and interfaces with the operating system\n- Commands follow the pattern: `command -options arguments`\n- The file system is a hierarchical tree starting at `/`\n- Navigation uses `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`\n- File operations include `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, and `touch`\n- Good naming conventions prevent problems\n- Manual pages (`man`) provide detailed help\n\nThese commands form the foundation for everything else in Unix. Practice them until they become automatic!\n\n## Additional Reading {.unnumbered}\n\nTo further develop your Unix skills:\n\n- **[The Linux Command Line](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)** by William Shotts — A comprehensive, free book on Linux command-line fundamentals\n- **[Software Carpentry: The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)** — An excellent interactive tutorial designed for scientists\n- **\"The Unix Programming Environment\"** by Kernighan and Pike — A classic text on Unix philosophy and tools\n- **[Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/)** — An interactive tool that breaks down complex shell commands into understandable parts\n- **[Linux Pocket Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/linux-pocket-guide/9781098157913/)** by Daniel Barrett — A handy quick reference for essential commands\n\nFor macOS-specific Unix guidance:\n\n- **[macOS Terminal User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/)** — Apple's official documentation for the Terminal application\n\n## Exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Practice Exercises\"}\n**Exercise 1: Navigation Practice**\n\nWithout using a GUI file browser:\n\n1.
