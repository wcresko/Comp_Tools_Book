    "text": "Why This Book?\nModern scientific research is fundamentally computational. Whether you’re analyzing genomic sequences, processing microscopy images, modeling biological systems, or managing experimental data, computational literacy has become as essential as laboratory technique. Yet many graduate students enter their programs without formal training in these foundational skills.\nThis book bridges that gap by providing a practical, hands-on introduction to the core computational tools you’ll use throughout your scientific career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Philosophy\n\n\n\nThis is a practical course, and we will learn by doing. Each chapter includes worked examples, exercises, and real-world applications drawn from bioengineering and life sciences research.",

    "text": "How to Use This Book\nEach chapter builds on previous material, so I recommend reading them in order, at least initially. Key features include:\n\n\nCallout boxes highlighting important concepts, tips, and warnings\n\nCode examples that you can copy and modify for your own work\n\nPractice exercises to reinforce your learning\n\nCross-references connecting related concepts across chapters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHands-On Practice\n\n\n\nThe best way to learn computational skills is to type the commands yourself. Avoid copying and pasting when possible—the muscle memory of typing commands is part of the learning process.",
