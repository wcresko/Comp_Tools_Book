# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Foundational Computational Tools for Bioengineers*, a comprehensive guide designed to equip graduate students with essential computational skills for modern research in biology, bioengineering, and related life sciences.

## Why This Book?

Modern scientific research is fundamentally computational. Whether you're analyzing genomic sequences, processing microscopy images, modeling biological systems, or managing experimental data, computational literacy has become as essential as laboratory technique. Yet many graduate students enter their programs without formal training in these foundational skills.

This book bridges that gap by providing a practical, hands-on introduction to the core computational tools you'll use throughout your scientific career.

::: {.callout-tip title="Learning Philosophy"}
This is a **practical course**, and we will **learn by doing**. Each chapter includes worked examples, exercises, and real-world applications drawn from bioengineering and life sciences research.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

- Understand computer architecture and choose appropriate computing resources for your analyses
- Navigate file systems and automate tasks using Unix/Linux commands
- Write shell scripts to create reproducible analysis pipelines
- Process and analyze large biological datasets using command-line tools
- Program in R for statistical analysis and data visualization
- Apply tidy data principles for effective data management
- Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Submit and manage jobs on high-performance computing clusters

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required! However, you should have:

- Access to a computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Willingness to learn through practice and experimentation
- Patience with yourself as you develop new skills

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter builds on previous material, so I recommend reading them in order, at least initially. Key features include:

- **Callout boxes** highlighting important concepts, tips, and warnings
- **Code examples** that you can copy and modify for your own work
- **Practice exercises** to reinforce your learning
- **Cross-references** connecting related concepts across chapters

::: {.callout-note title="Hands-On Practice"}
The best way to learn computational skills is to **type the commands yourself**. Avoid copying and pasting when possible—the muscle memory of typing commands is part of the learning process.

## Course Materials

This book accompanies a graduate-level course taught at the University of Oregon's Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Additional materials, including lecture slides and homework assignments, are available on the course website.

## Acknowledgments

This book draws on many excellent resources, including Software Carpentry workshops [@softwarecarpentry2024shell; @softwarecarpentry2024git], the tidyverse documentation [@wickham2023r], and the experiences of countless students who have taken this course and provided valuable feedback.

Special thanks to the Research Advanced Computing Services (RACS) team at the University of Oregon for their support with Talapas computing resources, and to the Knight Campus community for fostering an environment of interdisciplinary learning.
